  <h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this page is to provide a short introduction to the RMT tool, how to install it together will all the prerequisites and how one can use the tool to prove partial correctness, and later total correctness of programs.
    You can use the links below to quickly navigate to the senction which interests you.

  <h2 id="Installation"> Installation and compilation </h2>
  <p>
    The RMT tool uses an SMT solver for logical proofs. As such, an SMT solver is needed before RMT can be used.
    <br/>
    By default, RMT uses the Z3 solver. You can download Z3 from <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases">here</a> and follow the readme in order to complete the installation. To check that the installation completed successfully, you can run <i>z3</i> (with no input), in which case you should see the text below, or you can try to run z3 on an example from <a href="https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/"> here </a>.
    <div class="codebox">
      <code>
        Error: input file was not specified.
        For usage information: z3 -h
      </code>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once Z3 has been installed, you can download the RMT tool using <i>git</i> by cloning it from the repository:
    <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          &gt; git clone https://github.com/ciobaca/rmt
        </code>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    After cloning, you should compile the sources in the <i>src</i> folder.
    <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          &gt; g++ -O2 -Wall -o rmt src/*.cpp
        </code>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    On Windows, you can also use Visual Studio for compilation, either by using <i>cl.exe</i> dirrectly or by creating a C++ Console Application project in the Visual Studio IDE and adding all the source files in the <i>src</i> folder. Not that we recommend compiling on Release and not on Debug, as there is a noticeable speed difference when running the tool.
    <br>
    After compilation, the tool should be ready to use.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Running_RMT"> Running RMT </h2>

  <p>
    The RMT tool reads from the standard input, so in order to run the RMT binary on a file, you just redirrect the file to stdin. For example, to run the tool on one of the examples included in the <i>examples</i> directory, you can run:
    <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          &gt; rmt.exe examples\z-all-examples\example1.rmt
        </code>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    For this particular example, the tool should produce an output similar to this:
    <div class="codebox">
        <code>
          2 solutions.
          Solution #1:
          loop(mplus(S,N),mminus(N,mone)) if mle(mone,N)
          Solution #2:
          done(S) if bnot(mle(mone,N))
        </code>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    More about running the tool, such as optional parameters, different commands that can be executed, troubleshooting etc can be found in the <i>README</i> file downloaded from the git repository.
