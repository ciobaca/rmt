    <h1>RMT</h1>

    RMT is a tool for proving reachability properties in constrained
    term rewriting systems. It is a command line tool. In order to
    obtain it, install it and use it, follow the instructions below.

    <h2>To report problems</h2>

    If there is something that is not working or if you have questions
    on RMT, please contact me at: stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com.

    <h2>Installing RMT</h2>

    <h3>From source</h3>

    <ol>

      <li> <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases">Download</a> and
      install Z3 for your platform, if not already installed. Make
      sure that the Z3 binary is in your PATH. You can check that this
      is the case by opening the command prompt/bash and running <span class="scode">z3</span>.

	If all goes well, you should see something like this:

	<div class="code">> z3
Error: input file was not specified.
For usage information: z3 -h</div>

      </li>

      <li> (optional) <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">Download</a> and
      install CMake, if not already installed. You only need CMake if
      you plan to contribute to RMT.
      </li>

      <li> (optional) <a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/">Download></a> and
      install CVC4, if not already installed. You only need CVC4 if
      you are not happy with using Z3 as your SMT solver.</li>

      <li> <a href="rmtsrc.zip">Download</a> the RMT source code itself
      and unpack it in a directory of your choice. </li>

      <div class="code">> unzip rmtsrc.zip</div>

      <li> Compile RMT. You have two choices:
	<ul>
	  <li> If you have CMake installed, run the following commands in the directory where you unzipped rmt:
	    <div class="code">> cmake .
> make</div>
	  </li>
	  <li> If you do not have CMake installed, run the following command:
	    <div class="code">> g++ -O2 -o main *.cpp</div>
	  </li>
	</ul> Test RMT. If everything went well, you should be able to
	run RMT:<div class="code">> ./main -v 0 < sum.rmt</div>
      </li>

      <li> (optional) Install Emacs support for RMT. Add the file
      "rmt-mode.el" that is part of the .zip file you downloaded to
      your ".emacs" file. </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Binaries</h3>

    Follow steps 1-4 and 6 above. Download the executable for you platform and place it in a directory of your choice:

    <ul>

    <li>MacOSX 10.9: <a href="macbinary.zip">RMT binary for Mac OS X</a></li>

    <li>Linux (binary will be available on the 24th of October): <a href="rmt-binary-linux.zip">RMT
    binary for Linux (compiled on Ubuntu)</a></li>

    <li>Windows (binary will be available on the 24th of October): <a href="rmt-binary-windows.zip">RMT binary for Windows</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Using RMT</h2>

    You can run RMT on the set of examples provided in the .zip files
    you downloaded. For example, you can try to run RMT on the file
    <span class="scode">example1.rmt</span>:

    <div class="code">./main -v 0 < example1.rmt</div>
    
    The RMT executable has only one option: <span class="code">-v N</span> determines the verbosity. <span class="code">N</span> is
    the verbosity level. It currently runs from 0 (minimal) to 12
    (maximal). Be warned that, when the verbosity level is 12, a lot
    of output is printed out.

    Even without a high verbosity level, the proof trees output by RMT
    are sometimes very large. In this case, we suggest that you pipe
    the output to less as follows:

    <div class="code">./main -v 0 < example1.rmt 2>&1 | less -S</div>

    The <span class="scode">2>&1</span> option redirects stderr to stdout. The <span class="scode">-S</span> option for <span class="scode">less</span> stops
    line wrapping.

    <h2>Next up</h2>

    Check out the example files that come with RMT. Read each of them
    to learn about RMT and run them as explained above. There are several examples, each having the filename <span class="scode">exampleN.rmt</span>.

    <h2>But something does not work</h2>

    Ooops. Here are some things to check:

    <ul>
      <li>RMT does not compile.</li>

      Are you using a modern compiler? We have successfully compiled
      RMT on Linux, MacOSX and Windows using recent versions of clang,
      gcc and respectively Visual Studio.

      <li>RMT compiled, but it does not run.</li>

      If you are on Linux, did you remember to prefix the executable
      name with "./", as the current directory is not in the PATH by
      default? If you are on Windows, is the executable in the current
      directory?

      <li>RMT segfaults.</li>

      <p>Ooops. There are several reasons why RMT can segfault. The most
      common case is that the Z3 executable is not found. Make sure
      that z3 is installed and that the directory where the z3
	executable lives is in the path.</p>

      <p>The second thing to check is access rights. RMT communicates
      with z3 by creating a "z3_temp.input" file in the current
      directory and reading back the result from
      "z3_temp.output". Therefore RMT needs read and write access.</p>

      <p>The other reason why RMT might crash is an internal error. RMT
      compiles with assertion on by default. Therefore you should get
      at least an idea of why it crashed. You can always increase the
      verbosity level (use "-v 12" for maximal verbosity) and see
      where it crashes.</p>

      <p>Make sure that you have defined all of the expected built-in
      signature correctly (boolean and operations on booleans, etc.).</p>
      
      <p>Also, please report any crashes to me
      (stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com). Crash reports will help improve the
      tool.</p>

      <li>RMT runs, but I cannot make sense of the output.</li>

      Yeap, I know. Some of the proof trees output by RMT are really
      huge. They can be a mess to navigate, especially when you are
      trying to debug a circularity. The best way around this is to
      pipe the output through <span class="scode">less -S</span> as
      explained above. You can then navigate the output using the
      arrow keys.

      <li>RMT works, but the output is incorrect.</li>

      Are you sure that it's a bug? You might have forgotten something
      in your specification or z3 might not be able to handle the
      problems it receives from RMT. However, if you are reasonably
      sure that it's a bug in RMT, please report it to me
      (stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com) as this will help improve the tool.

      <li>I tried to specify a reachability property, but the tool
      says there are proof obligations left.</li>

      There are several things that might have gone wrong: (1) The
      search depth is not big enough. You can increase the search
      depth by adding parameters to "prove" as in the following
      example:

      <div class="code">prove [200,3] in here : what;</div>

      200 represented the maximum depth and 5 the maximum branching
      depth. By default, they are 100 and 2. (2) The second
      possibility is that z3 cannot handle your problem (it might
      timeout or return unknown). Try to run z3 by hand on the proof
      obligations generated by the RMT. (3) The last problem is that
      the circularities that you have specified are untrue or
      incomplete. You might want to go through them one more time, as
      they can be tricky to get right.

      <p>Do not hesitate to contact me (stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com) if you need assistance with this.</p>
