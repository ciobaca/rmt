    RMT is a tool for proving reachability properties in constrained
    term rewriting systems. It is a command line tool. In order to
    obtain it, install it and use it, follow the instructions below.

      RMT is described in the following article (submitted): <a href="rmtsubmission.pdf">PDF file </a> submitted.

    <h2>To report problems</h2>

    If there is something that is not working or if you have questions
    on RMT, please contact me at: stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com.

    <h2>Installing RMT</h2>

    <h3>From source</h3>

    <ol>

      <li> <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases">Download</a> and
      install Z3 for your platform, if not already installed. Make
      sure that the Z3 binary is in your PATH. You can check that this
      is the case by opening the command prompt/bash and running <span class="scode">z3</span>.

	If all goes well, you should see something like this:

	<div class="code">> z3
Error: input file was not specified.
For usage information: z3 -h</div>

      </li>

      <li> (optional) <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">Download</a> and
      install CMake, if not already installed. You only need CMake if
      you plan to contribute to RMT.
      </li>

      <li> (optional) <a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/">Download></a> and
      install CVC4, if not already installed. You only need CVC4 if
      you are not happy with using Z3 as your SMT solver.</li>

      <li> <a href="rmtsrc.zip">Download</a> the RMT source code itself
      and unpack it in a directory of your choice. </li>

      <div class="code">> unzip rmtsrc.zip</div>

      <li> Compile RMT. Do not worry too much about the possible
	warnings you get during the compilation process. You have two
	choices for compilation:<ul>

	  <li> If you have CMake installed, run the following commands
	  in the directory where you unzipped rmt:
	    <div class="code">> cmake .
> make</div>
	  </li>
	  <li> If you do not have CMake installed, run the following command:
	    <div class="code">> g++ -O2 -o main *.cpp</div>
	  </li>

	  <li>If you are compiling in Windows, add all *.cpp and *.h header files to a project in a recent version of Visual Studio. You will also need to get an implementation of the "getopt.h" POSIX header file. We suggest to use this <a href="https://www.codefull.org/2015/04/cannot-find-getopt-h-header-file-when-compiling-under-windows/">getopt.h header file</a> and add it to the project before compiling. </li>

	</ul>

	Test RMT:

	<ul>
	  <li>On Linux and MacOSX, if everything went well, you should
	    be able to run RMT as follows from a shell:<div class="code">> ./main -v 0 < example1.rmt</div></li>

	  <li>On Windows, run RMT as follows from the command prompt:<div class="code">> rmt.exe -v 0 < example1.rmt</div></li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li> (optional) Install Emacs support for RMT. Add the file
      "rmt-mode.el" that is part of the .zip file you downloaded to
      your ".emacs" file. </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Binaries</h3>

    Follow steps 1-4 and 6 above. Download the executable for you
    platform and place it in a directory of your choice. Make sure you
    set the executions rights on the binary.

    <ul>

    <li>MacOSX 10.9: <a href="macbinary.zip">RMT binary for Mac OS X</a></li>

    <li>Linux: <a href="linuxbinary.zip">RMT binary for Linux
    (compiled on Ubuntu 16.04)</a></li>

    <li>Windows: <a href="windowsbinary.zip">RMT binary for Windows</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Using RMT</h2>

    You can run RMT on the set of examples provided in the .zip files
    you downloaded. For example, you can try to run RMT on the file
    <span class="scode">example1.rmt</span>:

    <div class="code">./main -v 0 < example1.rmt</div>
    
    The RMT executable has only one option: <span class="code">-v N</span> determines the verbosity. <span class="code">N</span> is
    the verbosity level. It currently runs from 0 (minimal) to 12
    (maximal). Be warned that, when the verbosity level is 12, a lot
    of output is printed out.

    Even without a high verbosity level, the proof trees output by RMT
    are sometimes very large. In this case, we suggest that you pipe
    the output to less as follows:

    <div class="code">./main -v 0 < example1.rmt 2>&1 | less -S</div>

    The <span class="scode">2>&1</span> option redirects stderr to stdout. The <span class="scode">-S</span> option for <span class="scode">less</span> stops
    line wrapping.

    <h2>Next up</h2>

    Check out the example files that come with RMT. Read each of them
    to learn about RMT and run them as explained above. There are several examples, each having the filename <span class="scode">exampleN.rmt</span>.

    <h2>But something does not work</h2>

    Ooops. Here are some things to check:

    <ul>
      <li>RMT does not compile.</li>

      Are you using a modern compiler? We have successfully compiled
      RMT on Linux, MacOSX and Windows using recent versions of clang,
      gcc and respectively Visual Studio. If you are on MacOSX, you
      need to install the developer tools. If you have recently
      upgraded the MacOsX system, you might need to reinstall the
      developer tools.

      <li>RMT compiled, but it does not run.</li>

      If you are on Linux, did you remember to prefix the executable
      name with "./", as the current directory is not in the PATH by
      default? If you are on Windows, is the executable in the current
      directory?

      <li>RMT segfaults.</li>

      <p>Ooops. There are several reasons why RMT can segfault. The most
      common case is that the Z3 executable is not found. Make sure
      that z3 is installed and that the directory where the z3
	executable lives is in the path.</p>

      <p>The second thing to check is access rights. RMT communicates
      with z3 by creating a "z3_temp.input" file in the current
      directory and reading back the result from
      "z3_temp.output". Therefore RMT needs read and write access.</p>

      <p>The other reason why RMT might crash is an internal error. RMT
      compiles with assertion on by default. Therefore you should get
      at least an idea of why it crashed. You can always increase the
      verbosity level (use "-v 12" for maximal verbosity) and see
      where it crashes.</p>

      <p>Make sure that you have defined all of the expected built-in
      signature correctly (boolean and operations on booleans, etc.).</p>
      
      <p>Also, please report any crashes to me
      (stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com). Crash reports will help improve the
      tool.</p>

      <li>RMT runs, but I cannot make sense of the output.</li>

      Yeap, I know. Some of the proof trees output by RMT are really
      huge. They can be a mess to navigate, especially when you are
      trying to debug a circularity. The best way around this is to
      pipe the output through <span class="scode">less -S</span> as
      explained above. You can then navigate the output using the
      arrow keys.

      <li>There is an error when executing example7.rmt.</li>

      Do you have a recent version of Z3? The smt-prelude in
      example7.rmt uses recursive function definitions, which were
      added relatively recently. You can try to replace the recursive
      definition with an axiomatization if you must use an old version
      of Z3.

      <li>How do I replace Z3 with CVC4? </li>

      In the file z3_driver.cpp, find the two lines below and comment
      out the first one and uncomment the second one:

      <div class="code">string prover = "z3 -T:2 -in <";
//string prover = "cvc4 --lang smtlib2";</div>

      Recompile the tool as described above. In order to use CVC4 on
      some file, add in the smt-prelude declaration a line "(set-logic
      ALL_SUPPORTED)". For example, the start of your .rmt file should
      look like this:
      <div class="code">smt-prelude "(set-logic ALL_SUPPORTED)
(define-fun f (Int Int) Int)
(assert (= 0 (f 0 0)))
[...]"
sorts Int / "Int", Bool / "Bool", State;
subsort Int < State;
[...]</div>

      <li>How do I debug an error with Z3?</li>

      The tool interacts with Z3 through two files: z3_temp.input and
      z3_temp.output. You can take a look at them in order to
      understand what the interaction with the SMT solver.

      <li>RMT works, but the output is incorrect.</li>

      Are you sure that it's a bug? You might have forgotten something
      in your specification or z3 might not be able to handle the
      problems it receives from RMT. However, if you are reasonably
      sure that it's a bug in RMT, please report it to me
      (stefan.ciobaca@gmail.com) as this will help improve the tool.

      <li>I tried to specify a reachability property, but the tool
      says there are proof obligations left.</li>

      There are several things that might have gone wrong: (1) The
      search depth is not big enough. You can increase the search
      depth by adding parameters to "prove" as in the following
      example:

      <div class="code">prove [200,3] in here : what;</div>

      200 represented the maximum depth and 5 the maximum branching
      depth. By default, they are 100 and 2. (2) The second
      possibility is that z3 cannot handle your problem (it might
      timeout or return unknown). Try to run z3 by hand on the proof
      obligations generated by the RMT. (3) The last problem is that
      the circularities that you have specified are untrue or
      incomplete. You might want to go through them one more time, as
      they can be tricky to get right.
